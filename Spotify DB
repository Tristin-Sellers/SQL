# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 



#1. Who is the most popular artist on the list and how many songs do they have on the list?
SELECT 
    artist_name  AS Artist,
    COUNT(*) AS Songs,
    AVG(popularity) AS Avg_Popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

    GROUP BY Artist
    ORDER BY Avg_Popularity DESC,
              Songs DESC
          LIMIT 1;


#2. How many times does every artist show up in the list,
SELECT
   artist_name AS Artist, 
   COUNT(*) AS Songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY Artist
    ORDER BY Songs DESC;

#3. Does having more songs on the top list mean that they are more popular? 
SELECT
   artist_name AS Artist, 
   COUNT(*) AS Songs,
   AVG(popularity) AS Popularity_Average
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY Artist
    ORDER BY Popularity_Average DESC
;

#4. who are the top starts of the data and the avg popularity of said artits, Writen with a CTE.
WITH 
    popularity_average_CTE 
AS (
SELECT 
    s.artist_name,
    AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
    GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  
    artist_name,
    average_popularity,
    'Top Star' AS tag

FROM popularity_average_CTE

    WHERE average_popularity>=90
;
